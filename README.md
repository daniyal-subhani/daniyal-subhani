# Daniyal Subhani

**Full-Stack Software Engineer**  
Focused on building clean, scalable, and maintainable web systems.

I work across the stack with a strong emphasis on fundamentals: clear data flow, predictable state, well-designed APIs, and pragmatic architecture. I prefer correctness and clarity over hype and shortcuts.
